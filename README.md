# DuckDuckGo Blacklight
![master](https://github.com/nicholasreynolds/duckduckgo-blacklight/workflows/main/badge.svg?branch=master)

## What is it?
This Firefox plugin inserts an expandable menu next 
to each search result item showing the trackers and 
other info present on the site. 

## How does it do this?
The data comes from blacklight.api.themarkup.org.

## Why do it this way?
Another option lies in the form of 
@themarkup/blacklight-collector, but that library 
uses its own headless Chromium binary to audit
urls and perform the web api's serverside logic itself. 
Considering I want to keep this plugin as lightweight 
as possible, this would simply be too much overhead, 
and so I'm sticking with the web api.

The api is publicly accessible without a token, 
though I haven't seen any dev-oriented marketing for it 
(or any at all). As such, and in the event people actually 
use this extension, I will conserve the traffic 
volume generated by not auto-querying any of the DDG 
result links. For now, it is up to the user to select 
which results require inspection.
